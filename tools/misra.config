// Note: This configuration file lists the deviated rules that will bring too
//       many warnings. However, this does not mean that they cannot be applied
//       for some particular code in the project.
//       Those checks are only run on the released code and not on the tests of
//       the library. The tests written for the library are less critical and
//       are expected to breaks more rules (Rule 11.4, Rule 17.1, Rule 21.4,
//       Rule 21.6, Rule 21.8).
//       Third-party libraries (mbedTLS and OP-TEE OS/Client) are not considered
//       in the report.
